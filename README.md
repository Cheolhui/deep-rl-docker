# deep-rl-docker :whale: :robot:
Docker image with OpenAI Gym, Baselines and Roboschool, utilizing TensorFlow and JupyterLab.

![Roboschool](https://github.com/eric-heiden/deep-rl-docker/blob/doc/roboschool.png?raw=true)

## Build
CPU version:
```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t uscresl/deep-rl-docker:tf1.4.0rc1-gym0.9.4-py3 .
```

GPU version:
```
nvidia-docker build -f Dockerfile.gpu -t uscresl/deep-rl-docker:tf1.4.0rc1-gym0.9.4-gpu-py3 .
```

Make sure the [NVIDIA requirements](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#NVIDIARequirements) to run TensorFlow with GPU support are satisfied. It helps to follow NVIDIA's [cuDNN installation guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html).

## Run
Execute `run.sh` or `run_gpu.sh`. This will run the container in foreground mode, i.e. its console becomes attached to the processâ€™s standard input, output, and standard error.

*All RL-related dependencies (Roboschool, Gym, etc.) are available from within the python3 environment.*

Jupyter Lab will be published on port 8888. If you run TensorBoard it will be accessible on port 6006. Ports are tunneled through to your host system and can be reconfigured in `run.sh` or `run_gpu.sh`.

The container will define a user (`$USER`) named `wal` which has its home folder under `/home/wal` on the host system via a shared volume. This user has the same user identifier (UID) as the host system's user running the container to ensure file permissions are set up correctly in the shared volumes.

## Save changes
Commit changes made to the container (e.g. installations, file changes inside the container and not a shared volume) via
```
docker commit $CONTAINER
```
Where `$CONTAINER` is the ID of the docker container. Issue `docker ps` to see all installed containers and their ID's.

## Resume
Start and reattach an existing docker container via
```
docker start  $CONTAINER
docker attach $CONTAINER
```
Where `$CONTAINER` is the ID of the docker container. Issue `docker ps` to see all installed containers and their ID's.

## Examples
Here are some cool demos to run:

### Roboschool
```
vglrun python3 $ROBOSCHOOL_PATH/agent_zoo/demo_race1.py
```
```
vglrun python3 $ROBOSCHOOL_PATH/agent_zoo/demo_keyboard_humanoid1.py
```
VirtualGL (`vglrun`) is required to support hardware-accelerated rendering.

### OpenAI Gym (from the [OpenAI blog post on DQN](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-dqn/))
```
# Train model and save the results to cartpole_model.pkl
python3 -m baselines.deepq.experiments.train_cartpole
# Load the model saved in cartpole_model.pkl and visualize the learned policy
python3 -m baselines.deepq.experiments.enjoy_cartpole
```

## TODO
* Fix Roboschool, Baselines dependency to specific GitHub-commit(?)
